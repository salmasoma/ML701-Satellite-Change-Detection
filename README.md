# ML701-Satellite-Change-Detection

This project leverages AI and multi-temporal satellite images to monitor urban changes. Addressing the limitations of traditional monitoring methods, it employs Semantic Change Detection (SCD) to detect and categorize urban transformations at the pixel level efficiently. By analyzing satellite imagery, the AI model developed in this project can extract critical data, such as building infrastructures, water, and vegetation, that was previously labor-intensive to obtain. This advancement in urban monitoring not only streamlines the process but also provides a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of urban dynamics. Five different model architectures were tested by evaluating the performance using accuracy, F-score, mean IoU, and separated kappa. The project's outcomes demonstrate a substantial leap in urban planning capabilities, offering a more informed and practical approach to managing urban transformations. The best-performing model was BiSRNet, which achieved an accuracy of 87.55\%, mIoU of 71.68\%, Sek of 20.64\%, and F-score of 61.29\%.
